## Plot data and labels to ensure they are aligned and look ok.
Steps:
1. Convert labels from SQL table to a csv that I can copy onto the remote drive
2. Load in an hdf5 file, rehydrate
3. Turn data into F-X plots
4. Plot F-X plots with corresponding bounding boxes

Making the csv should be done locally, then copied. I don't need to be working on the remote machine for that.
